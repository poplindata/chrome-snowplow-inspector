== Install
At the moment, only Chrome/Chromium are supported via an official app store, and builds for Firefox are available, but not supported.
To install the extension, visit the page on the link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/maplkdomeamdlngconidoefjpogkmljm[Chrome Web Store].
You can get builds for Firefox v60+ in link:https://github.com/poplindata/chrome-snowplow-inspector/releases[Releases].

=== Schema Validation
The extension options should let you load in local JSON Schema files during development, and you can also add your production or Snowplow Mini Iglu Repositories to test against what you have in production.

Both link:https://github.com/snowplow/iglu/wiki/Static-repo[Static Iglu Repositories] and link:https://github.com/snowplow/iglu/wiki/Iglu-server[Iglu Servers] (like the one used in link:https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-mini[Snowplow Mini]) are supported.

==== Adding an Iglu Repository
. Right-click the extension icon in the main browser toolbar
. Select Options
. Paste the URL to your repository in the Iglu Repositories field (if you're adding Snowplow Mini, you need to keep the `/iglu-server/api` suffix)
. Repository URLs can be separated by spaces, lines, or commas

By default we include the URL for link:https://github.com/snowplow/iglu-central[Iglu Central], which includes schemas for the built-in tracking JSONs. You can add as many repositories as you like.

For newer versions of Iglu Server, you need to include a UUID API key. In the options, you can attach this to a specific repo by including it in the URL as a username.
For example, `http://01234567-89ab-cdef-fedc-ba9876543210@mini.poplindata.com/iglu-server/api`

==== Repository Setup
Make sure you have access to your repository from your browser in order for the extension to find your schemas.
Typically repositories are hosted on S3, and by default the files may not be publically readable and will result in 403 errors.

For older versions of the extension, it was important to have your repository website or S3 bucket configured for link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing].
You can find out how to correctly configure an S3 bucket at link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/add-cors-configuration.html[How Do I Allow Cross-Domain Resource Sharing with CORS?] the default rule should work, the extension only requires GET access.
More recent versions shouldn't require CORS to be set up as long as you grant the extension permissions when adding a repository.

If schemas are still 'Unrecognised', try clearing your browser cache and the extension's Schema Cache.
Alternatively, you can import your schemas directly as Local Schemas in the extension Options page.

== Develop
=== Build
Run `npm install` to install required dependencies, then `npm run build` to build the extension in the `dist/` directory.

Instructions to install a local development version of the extension to test are over at the link:https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked[extension development documentation].

=== Hack
You can also use `npm start` to start parcel in watch mode and symlink the resources to make editing easier; source changes should then be reflected immediately in `dist/`.
You will still need to reload the extension in a browser.
